## Description

This is a 100days of code portfolio that i have created after finishing the 100days challenge. 
I have highlighted different section from the skills, projects, resources and what i will do next.
Before the challenge i didn't think you can actually make websites without a cs degree or bootcamp.
But i did it and i have learnt so much. The projects are done with vanilla JavaScript no frameworks.
